# Smart-Plant-Watering-System

This is my second year minor project focusing in embedded domain. The main motive behind the project is to design thes system which the helps the people finding it difficult to gave the water to the plant on regular basis.
The components of the project are RTC (# REAL TIME CLOCK),Moisture sensor,Arduino uno R3,LCD display.
The rtc is used to fetch the real time,it is used to set the time to water the plant on daily basis.The moisture sensor works in coordination with the rtc.
for ex. If the time is 8am to water the plant then at that time rtc will give signal to arduino to start the motor but at the same time moisture sensor will detect the moisture from the soil if their is no requirement of water at that time then moisture sensor will give another signal to not start the motor.
You can find the individual version of the project like "Watering system using moisture  sensor","RTC based watering system". But our project consist both of this working in coordination & this project is not available on google.
You can try this to get more clear idea and working!!!
